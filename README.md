## Local Development

If you'd like to see your changes locally you can use `Python3` to serve up the content by:

```bash
python -m http.server # Defaults to port 8000, you can change by providing an additional integer for the desired port
```

## Questions?

Ask for help in the [Diversity and Inclusion workgroup - Python Software Foundation Slack](thepsf.slack.com) in the `#/diversity-and-inclusion` channel.
